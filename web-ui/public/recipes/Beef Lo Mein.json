    "name": "Beef Lo Mein",
    "description": "I have made an Oyster Sauce Lo Mein recipe not so long ago. Even though it was a basic flavor, I got so many compliments. Everybody loves it. Today, we gonna upgrade it into a beef lo mein recipe. It is also easy and tasty. The beef is so tender and velvety. The noodles are flavorful. It got lots of umami taste from the oyster sauce. You can also use chicken, pork, shrimp instead of beef and create your own variations of lo mein.",
