## PREP INGREDIENTS
1. Thinly slice the green onions, separating the whites and greens. Finely chop the garlic cloves.
2. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Depending on your preference, remove the skin or leave it on.

## MAKE SAUCE
1. To a small container, add 3 cloves of minced garlic along with the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, corn syrup, mirin, dark soy sauce (if using), cornstarch, and black pepper to taste.
2. Take 1 or 2 dried chilies. Tear them into pieces and add them to the sauce. Mix together.

## MAKE CHICKEN BULGOGI
1. In a large pan, heat the oil (1 tbsp) over medium-high heat. (If you didnâ€™t remove the chicken skin, you can skip the oil, but place your chicken, skin side down.) Once it gets nice and hot, add in the chicken. Cook for 6 to 7 minutes or until it gets a little bit of color.
2. Add the white parts of the green onions. Saute for 30 seconds or until fragrant.
3. Reduce the heat to medium and pour the sauce. Stir them all together for 1 to 2 minutes or until the sauce is thickened and chicken is nicely coated.

4. Turn the heat off. Add the sesame oil (1 tsp) and give it a little toss. Set aside.

## MAKE CHILI PEPPER SALAD
1. Cut the chili peppers into bite-sized pieces. Shake the seeds out if you like. Transfer to a mixing bowl.
2. In a medium bowl, mix together the Korean soybean paste, Korean chili pepper flakes, minced garlic (1/2 tbsp), corn syrup, sesame oil, and (ground) sesame seeds. Pour it over the chili peppers and toss together.

## ASSEMBLE
1. Divide the rice into serving bowls. Add a generous amount of chicken bulgogi.
2. Add some salad on the side. Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds.
