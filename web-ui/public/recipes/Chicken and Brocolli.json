After you make sure that every piece of chicken is coated nicely, you still want to keep massaging it for another 5 minutes until you can feel that the chicken has a velvety texture. Cornstarch and egg white will give a lot of moisture to the chicken and creates a starchy layer to lock the juiciness inside the meat. That is the key to a tender juicy meat."

Turn the cut surface face to the pan and wait for it to change color. In about 2 minutes, you can give it a little peek. If you see the color is nice like this one, flip them over and sear the other side. What I am looking for is sort of roasted broccoli. Trust me, this is going to taste really good. Set the vegetable aside and move on to the chicken."

Make sure every piece of the chicken touches the bottom directly. Wait for 1 minute or 2 and you can check the color. If you see it is nice and brown on the bottom then flip all the chicken over. Fry the other side. When both sides have nice color, that is what we are looking for. You can add the broccoli back to the wok. Give that a toss then pour in that delicious sauce. Toss everything together and taste it to see if you need more salt."
