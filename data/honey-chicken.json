          "Marinate the chicken: In a large bowl, mix the chicken with the marinade ingredients and let it marinate for 10–15 minutes.",

          "Fry the chicken: Heat oil in a wok over medium-high heat until hot enough for deep frying. Fry the chicken in batches for 3–4 minutes until golden and cooked through. Drain on paper towels or a wire rack.",
          "Make the sauce: In a clean wok, heat vegetable oil on medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for about 15 seconds until fragrant. Then add the prepared honey sauce mixture and cook for 2–3 minutes until the sugar dissolves and the sauce begins to boil.",
          "Thicken the sauce: Add the starch water and cook for 1–2 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.",
          "Combine: Add the fried chicken pieces to the sauce and toss well so that every piece is evenly coated.",
          "Finish: Transfer to a serving plate. Drizzle with extra honey sauce if desired, and sprinkle with chopped green onions and toasted sesame seeds."
