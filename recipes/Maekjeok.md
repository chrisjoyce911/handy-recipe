## Marinate Pork
1. Score the pork belly on both sides. Cut it into bite-sized pieces.
2.In a mixing bowl, mix together the Korean soybean paste, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, mirin, minced garlic, corn syrup, sesame oil, and black pepper to taste.
3. Add the pork belly. Gently massage it. Cover and marinate in the fridge for 30 minutes or overnight.

## Make Chive Salad
1.Take a big handful of chives and cut them into 2.5 inches (5cm) long. Take out the seeds and julienne the red chili (if using).
2. Prepare the dressing. In a small container, mix together the Korean chili pepper flakes, vinegar, sugar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, minced garlic, and fish sauce. Pour it over the chives and toss together.

## Cook Marinated Pork
1. In a large pan, add a little bit of oil and coat the bottom of the pan with paper towels. Heat it over medium heat.
2. Once it gets nice and hot, place the pork belly. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes. (It can burn easily, so please keep an eye on this and try to flip them every few seconds.)

## Assemble
1. To serve, divide the rice into serving bowls. Add a generous amount of maekjeok. Optionally, hit it with a blowtorch. 
2. Add some chive salad and soft-boiled egg (if using). Finish with sesame seeds. Enjoy!
