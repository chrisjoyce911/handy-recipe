## MAKE CASHEW CHICKEN
1. Roast the cashews: In a large wok (or pan), add 2 tablespoons of oil. Heat it over medium heat. Once it gets nice and hot, add the cashews. Roast for 2 to 3 minutes or until deep dark brown. Remove from the pan, leaving the oil behind.
  * 1/2 cup (75g) unsalted raw (or roasted) cashews
2. Cook the chicken: Place the same wok over high heat. Once it’s heated, add the marinated chicken. Spread it out and let it sear for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden brown on the bottom. Flip and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.
3. Place the same wok over medium heat. Into the chicken fat, add the garlic, ginger, and white parts of the green onions. Saute for 1 minute or until fragrant. (If there’s not enough oil because you used chicken breast, you can add 1 or 2 tablespoons of oil.)
  * 4 cloves garlic
  * 1/2 tsp (2g) grated ginger
  * white parts of the green onions
4. Increase the heat to high. Add the onion and bell peppers. Stir-fry it for 1 minute. Add the chicken back into the wok. Toss together for 30 seconds.
  * 1/2 yellow onion
  * 2 cups red, yellow, and/or green bell peppers
5. Give the sauce a quick stir and add it to the wok. Stir everything together until the sauce is thickened. Turn the heat off. Add the rest of the green onions and cashews. Give it a final mix.
   * white parts of the green onions
