## Instructions
1. In a large mixing bowl, mix together Chicken, Chinese Cooking Wine, Light Soy Sauce, and Egg White. Set aside to marinate for 10 â€“ 15 minutes.
2. In another bowl, combine Chicken Bouillon, Water, Chinese Cooking Wine, Rice Vinegar, Light Soy Sauce, Honey, and Brown Sugar. Set aside.
3. In another large bowl, add in All-purpose Flour and Cornstarch, mix well. Then add in the Chicken pieces and the marinade. Use your hand to mix well the flour and the chicken to create an uneven coating. Shake off extra flour.
4. In a wok, add in enough Oil for the Chicken pieces to float, on medium-high heat. Add the Chicken pieces one at a time into the hot oil. Fry the chicken in batches. Cook for 3-4 minutes until golden and cooked through. Drain on paper towel or a wire wrack.
5. In a clean wok, add in the Vegetable Oil, on medium heat. Add the Garlic, and cook for about 15 seconds until fragrant. Then add the Honey Sauce mixture. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the Sugar has dissolved and the sauce starts to boil.
6. Add in the Starch Water. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the sauce has thickened up slightly. Add in the fried Chicken pieces and toss well with the sauce. Make sure to coat the sauce evenly.
7. Transfer to a serving plate or bowl. Drizzle with some extra Honey Sauce on top. Sprinkle with some chopped Green Onions and toasted Sesame Seeds. Ready to enjoy!
