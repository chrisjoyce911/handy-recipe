# Mongolian Beef

This is not really an authentic Chinese food. It is more like an Americanized take out dish, but is is so savory, sweet, and flavorful. I can indulge in a few bowls of rice with it easily. If you donâ€™t know what to cook for dinner. This is it because everybody loves crispy chicken bites that are covered with a glossy sauce.

## Stir Fry Ingredients
* 1 table spoon minced ginger
* 1 1/2 table spoon minced garlic
* 1 bunch spring onion use the white part to stir fry and reserve the green part to add at the end

## Marinade Ingredients
* 454g chicken 
* 1.5 table spoon Chinese cooking wine
* 1/4 tea spoon salt
* 1/2 table spoo soy sauce
* 2 table spoon cornstarch
* 1 egg white

## Sauce Ingredients
* 1 table spoon cornstarch
* 2.5 table spoon soy sauce
* 1 table spoon oyster sauce
* 3.5 table spoon brown sugar
* 1/2 tea spoon white pepper
* 1/2 cup water

## PREP INGREDIENTS
1. Cut the chicken breast in half, then slice it into 1/3-inch thick pieces. You can also use boneless skinless chicken thighs if you prefer dark meat.
2. Marinade the chicken with
  * 1.5 table spoon Chinese cooking wine
  * 1/4 tea spoon salt
  * 1/2 table spoo soy sauce
  * 1 egg white
  * 2 table spoon cornstarch
3. Spread 1/3 cup of the cornstarch in a big container. Add the marinaded chicken one by one. Sprinkle more cornstarch on the top to cover the chicken. Put on the lid and shake well.
4. Open the lid and the chicken should be coated nicely. Remove the chicken and use a sieve to shake off the excess starch. Set the chicken aside and continue to coat the next batch. You can also use a big plastic bag, but I decided to reduce the use of plastic so it is your choice.
5. Once done, let the coated chicken rest on a try for 15 minutes so the starch has enough time to bond together, and it will fall off less when deep frying.

## MAKE SAUCE
1. Mix the Sauce and set aside ready for stir-frying
  * 1 table spoon cornstarch
  * 2.5 table spoon soy sauce
  * 1 table spoon oyster sauce
  * 3.5 table spoon brown sugar
  * 1/2 tea spoon white pepper
  * 1/2 cup water

## Stir Fry 
1. Heat 1.5 cups of oil in a wok to 380 F. Fry the chicken in 2 batches over medium heat, about 3 - 4 minutes for each batch. Use a sieve to eliminate the starch crumbs in between the frying.
2. Once the chicken is done frying, remove from the oil and set it aside
3. Pour most of the oil out, but leave 1.5 tsp in the wok. Add minced garlic, ginger, and a white part of the scallion. Stir over medium heat for 2-3 minutes or until the aromatics are slightly golden on the edge. Pour the sauce and keep mixing until the sauce thickens.
4. Introduce the chicken back into the wok, along with the green part of the scallions. Toss everything until the chicken is coated nicely. 1 Tbsp of toasted sesame seeds. Serve with white rice.
